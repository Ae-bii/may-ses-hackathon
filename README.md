# Financial Lingo

Room 26's submission for the May 2022 Capital One Software Engineering Summit! Take a look here: https://may-ses-hackathon.aebii.repl.co/



## Our Pitch

### Problem

We don’t know what to invest in or how to spend money wisely, especially as college students.

### Solution

We created an intuitive beginner-friendly website that recommends to customers ways they can spend, budget, and invest their money.

### Benefits

This website improves financial literacy and forming of good lifelong financial habits, personalized for each customer based on their current knowledge, financial resources, and their demographics.

## Our website focuses

### Spending

We want to encourage customers to build a strong credit score through visual balance bars and ‘gamefied’ goals.

### Budgeting

We want customers to set goals for their budget while being able to compare their spending and goals to similar customers.

### Investing

We want investing to be as easy as ordering food on UberEats by having information at customers’ fingertips.


## If we had more time, we would add...

- Colors indicating overspending in the budgeting tab
- Flippable cards with further information in the investing tab
- Sort-by option for the flippable cards
- Pull data from Capital One API
- Algorithm for calculating recommended budgets using customer information
- Data sharing for comparing customer budgets and spending
- Media queries to CSS for mobile compatibility

## What we learned and applied:

- Figma for our mockup
- React.js
- Mongo DB API for login system
- Git workflow
- Apexcharts for data visualizations

## What we took away!

- There's a lot to learn from each other, especially as even though we have similar foundations in programming, we all had different specializations and experiences from our personal projects and academic interests
- That we are capable of making a working and visually sound website in just 36 hours!
- How to work with a Git workflow but more specifically, how to divide work based on strengths, how to label code clearly and explain changes to group members, and how to check each others' work in how it fit into our parts and the website as a whole
- A really good hackathon experience because we all got along so well(!) and meshed our strengths nicely to make our final project
